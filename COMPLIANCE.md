# Licensing compliance

Using FunQL software in a commercial product without releasing your source code under [GPLv2](
https://github.com/funql/funql-playground-api/blob/main/LICENSE-GPL) or purchasing a [commercial license](
https://funql.io/code/licensing/) can have legal ramifications. By integrating FunQL software, you agree to comply with
GPLv2 terms.

We cannot determine whether your application complies with GPLv2. It is your responsibility to review and understand the
licensing terms. To ensure compliance, we strongly recommend consulting legal counsel or licensing specialists rather
than relying on informal advice.

Any application using FunQL software — or other OSS-licensed code — without verifying its licensing compliance does so
at its own risk. If you are unsure which license is right for you, [contact us](mailto:support@funql.io) to discuss
licensing options.
