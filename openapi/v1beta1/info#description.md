## Introduction

The FunQL Playground API allows you to experiment with [FunQL](https://funql.io/) â€” the Functional Query Language that
simplifies and enhances API querying. Use this API to test features like filtering, sorting, and pagination on sample
datasets through a RESTful interface.

This specification is part of the FunQL Playground: a hosted environment for trying out FunQL queries without writing
any code. It is a great way to explore how FunQL requests are structured and how results are returned.
